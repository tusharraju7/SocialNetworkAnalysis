### Twitch Network Analysis for Streamer and Community Optimization

This repository houses an extensive analysis of Twitch’s social network using data from the Stanford Network Analysis Platform (SNAP). The focus is on enhancing user engagement and promoting new streamers by leveraging social network analytics.

**Key Features:**
1. Data Analysis: Utilizes undirected Twitch social network data to identify key players and community structures among English-speaking Twitch partners who have been active for up to 4 years.
2. Network Metrics: Analyzes network statistics such as density, transitivity, and various centrality measures to understand the network's structure and influential nodes.
3. Community Detection: Implements community detection algorithms (Girvan & Newman and Louvain Modularity) to find closely-knit groups that could be targeted for promotions and enhanced user interactions.
4. Interactive Visualizations: Provides interactive network visualizations using the Pyvis library to better understand and demonstrate the community dynamics and node importance.

**Objectives:**
The project aims to optimize Twitch’s strategy for promoting streamers and improving user retention by:
1. Identifying influential streamers who can effectively promote Twitch content.
2. Detecting communities to facilitate targeted marketing and content recommendation.
3. Analyzing network structures to optimize advertisement placements and content delivery.

This repository is perfect for data scientists interested in social network analysis, marketing strategists focusing on digital platforms, and developers looking to implement network analysis techniques in real-world applications.
